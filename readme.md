Google is offering a 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course designed to equip data scientists with the knowledge
and skills to tackle generative AI projects with confidence. It runs on the Kaggle platform from Monday,
November 11 to Friday, November 15 with a time commitment of around 3 hours per day.

he five-day program for the online course  is as follows:

Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering
Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interactions.

Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases
Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoff.

Day 3: Generative AI Agents
Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs  
Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI
Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI application.
